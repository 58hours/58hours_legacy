<comment author="goTOsleep" timestamp="7:15 AM [PST], Monday, October 20, 2008"><![CDATA[I don't know of any other gift than what I gave my lady for her birthday on this date(8/9) than Radiohead in NYC with the skyline of the city to the right and the statue of liberty behind us. The weather was perfect and so were the guys. Great setlist...Lucky was the only thing I was supprised not to hear...but Airbag came out of nowhere!!! ]]></comment>
<comment author="rollinJStone" timestamp="11:44 AM [PST], Monday, August 11, 2008"><![CDATA[Phenomenal is an understatement.  Not only was the set-list spot on with EVERY song from "In Rainbows" covered, but the band chemistry was the tightest I've ever seen (even during the slip-up on "Videotape," the band just laughed it on and jumped right back into it).  

What I was most impressed by, especially relative to the 2006 "Hail to the Thief" tour, was the spectacular light show.  It's safe to say that Andi Watson is officially now the band's 6th member with their innovative LED light (http://www.radiohead.com/themostgiganticflyingmouthforsometime/).  

Favorite moment of the show: Idioteque closer.  Taking as our lasting image Thom doing his funky gyration all over the stage made this the best Radiohead show I've been to.  

Next stop: Outside Lands!]]></comment>

<comment author="benmanship" timestamp="10:06 AM [PST], Monday, August 11, 2008"><![CDATA[something special is right! When your at a huge show like this and the band has a quiet spot in a song and you can hear a pin drop you know it's a special show. People(for the most part) kept their big new york mouths shut and listened to the music.]]></comment>
<comment author="mondaybox" timestamp="5:53 PM [PST], Sunday, August 10, 2008"><![CDATA[fantastic show, better than friday.  may have had something to do with the fact that i had a better place to watch from (in front of the sound desk), not sure.  highlights for me were "national anthem", "weird fishes/arpeggi", "faust arp", "exit music", "pyramid song" , "fake plastic trees" and "there there".   LOL at thom dedicating "airbag" to kings of leon - "if we were as good looking we'd be famous!".  it was great that during a slow song like "exit music" or a song like "pyramid song" you could head a pin drop.  the crowd was really into listening to the whole thing, which you don't often get at gigs, especially festivals.  respect.  btw, the guitar playing by jonny and ed during "pyramid song" is just insane.  so damn good.]]></comment>
<comment author="Paranoid Android" timestamp="1:47 PM [PST], Sunday, August 10, 2008"><![CDATA[This setlist is incorrect...Jigsaw Falling into Place was before The Bends, NOT after..everything else should be correct...

As far as the venue itself, horrible...the view of NYC was fantastic.  You could see the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island from the venue.  However, $100.00 for tickets, $25.00 for the Ferry ride (for those who purchased them later), and a limit of 5 beers for a 10+ hour festival was bogus.  Security everywhere policing us like we're in prison and to drink you had to be caged in like tigers unable to roam the grounds freely.  I've never seen such bull and I've been to tons of shows...$150.00 day and I couldn't even party like I wanted to...

As far as the people, they were great and as far as Radiohead...they NEVER disappoint!  Sound was great, lights were great, and the setlist was great (a little slow) but....certainly nothing to complain about...

Out of the 3 Radiohead shows I've seen, this is ranked 3 of 3, but it's great to hear all the new songs off of "In Rainbows"...on a scale of 1-10, I would give this show a 9 1/2...again, nothing disappointing about this show....]]></comment>

setlist was amazing.

Astroboy stop whining- no one wants to hear it.]]></comment>
<comment author="df" timestamp="12:30 PM [PST], Sunday, August 10, 2008"><![CDATA[best.show.ever! had to live through the nissan pavillion fiasco, but this more than made up for it! best band on the planet!!!]]></comment>
<comment author="Julianne" timestamp="8:36 AM [PST], Sunday, August 10, 2008"><![CDATA[Had to return to Liberty State for Radiohead's return after seeing them there in July 2001 - one of the best concert experiences ever!  At Friday's show, we couldn't believe how easy it was for people to watch from outside the venue along Liberty State's waterfront.  Saturday was sold out, so we returned to the waterfront on bikes, hoping to finally hear Airbag.  We were greatly rewarded with that, an unobstructed view (unlike from inside the crowd) and an overall superior setlist (The Bends, Planet Telex and Where I End).  Park and State police were kind enough to let us stay til the end of the show, but I can't imagine Goldenvoice will allow this kind of access next year.]]></comment>

<comment author="Astroboy" timestamp="7:33 AM [PST], Sunday, August 10, 2008"><![CDATA[What a crappy setlist, why this has to happen to me?, why I didn't go on friday?. Stage and lights are amazing, and the band sounded great, the only good surprise was planet Telex, But the show was ok anyway.
The organizers of this show are a bunch of greedy bastards they even put some buses to get out of there, thousand of people where waiting for the light rail, that's the least they could do when they charge a ticket $89.]]></comment>
