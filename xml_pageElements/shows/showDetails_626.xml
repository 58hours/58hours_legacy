They know how to Rock and Roll and yet they also have a way of making you cry while counvulsing out of control. I know now that creating music is the only goal I want to achieve during my lifetime. Bravo gang, Bravo.]]></comment>
<comment author="Erica" timestamp="10:30 PM [PST], Tuesday, May 27, 2008"><![CDATA[This was my 5th time seeing Radiohead, and I couldn't have asked for a better setlist.  "Planet Telex" was a nice surprise, as were "Optimistic" and "Lucky."  Their catalogue is quite deep by now, and I'm glad they're exploring it instead of having a "Fake Plastic Karma" singalong each night.  Having said that, I'll never tire of hearing "Pyramid Song."  From the pit, those giant light sticks made me feel like I was in a cathedral, or maybe I was simply filled with reverence for the band.  Looking forward to getting a distant view in LA and Santa Barbara later this summer.  ]]></comment>
<comment author="JohnC" timestamp="8:20 AM [PST], Monday, May 19, 2008"><![CDATA[I Wasn't too pleased with the setlist. As a bigger fan of the Bends/Ok Computer, I was disappointed not to hear Karma Police, Airbag, Just, Fake Plastic Trees, or Paranoid Android. All songs they have played recently. At least I got to hear "lucky"
Otherwise the show was pretty awesome. ]]></comment>

I found out they were coming to Houston in like December and had been waiting ever since!  The lights and everything were amazing.  Perfect sound.  I basically had a seizure when the beat dropped in Idioteque.]]></comment>
<comment author="jason" timestamp="8:41 AM [PST], Sunday, May 18, 2008"><![CDATA[this show was the best show i have experienced in my life! i have to tip my hat to the woodlands pavillion. for really raising the bar as far as live performances go! if there ia an artist/artists is coming to town and playing there. get tickets ASAP. best venue  by far! of course i was standing in pitt directly in between thom and jhonny. the 2 people standing on my right and left caught the setlist. they threw out 2. ]]></comment>
<comment author="max" timestamp="8:23 AM [PST], Sunday, May 18, 2008"><![CDATA[my first time seeing them live and they were amazing! wish they had played more stuff from the Bends though. i'll be going to every show of theirs i can from here on out!]]></comment>
<comment author="Eric" timestamp="7:41 AM [PST], Sunday, May 18, 2008"><![CDATA[Without a doubt, one of the best shows I've ever witnessed. The sound was perfect and the light show was just incredible. This is a band that just keeps getting better and better. 

Thanks Radiohead!]]></comment>
<comment author="RKMONKEY" timestamp="6:55 AM [PST], Sunday, May 18, 2008"><![CDATA[Saw Radiohead 1995, 2003, 2008. New band every time. 2008 version - haunting. Played all songs from In Rainbows. Always leave me wanting more.]]></comment>
<comment author="puroshaggy" timestamp="3:01 AM [PST], Sunday, May 18, 2008"><![CDATA[Strong Show.  15 Step as an opener is an excellent choice.  Upbeat yet still weird and dark.  Sets a tone that the band can really go anywhere with.  All the In Rainbows tunes were strong, particularly Weird Fishes and House of Cards.  There There ended the set in a frenzy and left us hungry for an encore but satisfied with a solid main set.  My personal highlight was the Bends Sandwich Encore- Planet Telex/Street Spirit to close the first encore.  Murmurs of no Idioteque slithered around me at this point and a lot of people were ready to be disappointed.  But the 2nd encore comes and after a hilarious Army (thanks to the upclose camera work on Yorke), the show stopping Idioteque did just that.
   The venue sucked though the sound was great and Radiohead's lighting rig is simply awesome.]]></comment>

<comment author="erin" timestamp="10:12 PM [PST], Saturday, May 17, 2008"><![CDATA[All I can say is WOW!  They never disappoint.  Pyramid song and street spirit were phenomenal. Hearing Planet Telex brought back some great memories... To quote Mr. Yorke "Cool Beans!"]]></comment>
