<comment author="bryanmatthew" timestamp="6:36 AM [PST], Tuesday, May 04, 2004"><![CDATA[I was afraid that the sound inside the vastness of makuhari messe (basically a concrete convention center used for trade shows) would be sub par compared to the outdoor venue they used when they where here for the summer sonic festival last august...the doors opened at 3, the show began at 5:15 with a solid 2+2=5. the setlist was well balanced and full of absolute winners (lucky, fake plastic, just, where I end, karma police, etc.) "fake plastic trees" was especially appreciated by the japanese crowd, and most of them seemed to get the words right to that one. other highlights include thom wincing at the camera perched on his piano and then laughing during "you and who's army" causing them to repeat a verse. the haunted demeanor and sampled japanese radio signal of "climbing up the walls" contorted into the intro for "national anthem" in what was easily my favorite part of the show. I would pay for a bootleg just so I could hear that again. had this been the first time that I saw radiohead live I'm sure that I would have left it completely mesmerized. surely they were very very good on saturday but I left feeling that the first night was an average radiohead show. that being said, it goes without saying that an average radiohead is still better than most anyone else at their very best. still, I felt very lucky to have a ticket for sundays show... ]]></comment>
