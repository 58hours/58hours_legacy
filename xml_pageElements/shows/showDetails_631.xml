<comment author="Libby " timestamp="1:16 PM [PST], Monday, July 07, 2008"><![CDATA[Fantastic show! This was my third Radiohead concert..Marley park in ?2006 maybe shaded this a little, in some ways, but it was bloody brilliant even so...They are such consummate musicians, they just get better and better; but when Thom sang Exit Music solo, the huge crowd nearly went crazy, but instead they stifled their roars and just went totally silent! You could hear every word of the song, and I could hear people around literally holding their breath, hanging on to every sound, every note! There was some break-through cheering for a few milliseconds between verses, cos people couldn't hold in their excitement, but it just died instantly when he began to sing again.. it was just electric ! I wasnt there the first night, Friday, I wouldv loved to see the rainbow! Fantastic. Cant  wait to see them again.  I would have liked to hear Like Spinning Plates again, but sure, maybe next time!]]></comment>
