<comment author="Jesse" timestamp="2:45 AM [PST], Friday, June 27, 2008"><![CDATA[I was standing quite far back but it seemed like the crowd wasnt really into it. There was a surreal vibe with an intense storm in the background that never actually washed over us.

It was the first time I saw Radiohead and was a very meditative experience, nearly soporific. Thom would just say 'Vielen Dank everybody' in between a few songs and asked Ã¬f everyone had drunk a lot. 

Idioteque, All I Need and Paranoid Android were highlights for me.]]></comment>
<comment author="Potemkin" timestamp="1:42 PM [PST], Tuesday, June 24, 2008"><![CDATA[My first Radiohead gig ever. Perfect. Too bad it was a festival but anyways I loved it. The otherwise around as usual, this time the concert opened the new album to me. In Rainbows sounds so much better now. And Lucky, the best song in the universe IMO, just made it perfect. I have to see you again.]]></comment>
