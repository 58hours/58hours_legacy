<comment author="Dean" timestamp="9:20 AM [PST], Tuesday, October 14, 2003"><![CDATA[I went to both 10/9 & 10/10 shows and these were the first times I had ever seen Radiohead live.  I've gotta say, I was really really impressed.  I agree with what someone said earlier in that I also feel like a different person after seeing them perform.  

The highlights for me were, first and foremost, "True Love Waits".  I liked how it was just Thom and his acoustic guitar.  Seeing/hearing that song live moved me.  Another highlight was "Creep".  I felt fortunate to be there when they cranked it out.  As much as I've heard it, I still haven't gotten tired of it.

Other highlights for me were:  1. how they opened the show with "2+2=5" and then "Sit Down. Stand Up", just like the album.  2.  them playing "Sail To The Moon" both nights.  It's such a hauntingly beautiful song.  3. "Exit Music (for a film)" - I liked how it was just Thom and Johnny, with the spotlights on them.  

Also, "Go To Sleep", "There There" and "Where I End And You Begin" sounded even better live than on the album.  I've become a bigger fan of "Go 2 Sleep" because of the show.

As for criticism, I could've done without "Punch Up At A Wedding" & "Myxomatosis".  I would've liked to hear "High And Dry" in place of either of those tracks...I was sad that they didn't play that song either night.  Also, I really wanted to hear "Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box" (maybe instead of "Everything In Its Right Place" one of the nights).

Aside from that, I really enjoyed the show.  Hats off to the Radiohead crew.  I also thought the light show was amazing...great use of colors and I liked how the lit up the crowd for the chorus of Creep.  Good times...]]></comment>
<comment author="sara" timestamp="11:27 AM [PST], Sunday, October 12, 2003"><![CDATA[after countless dollars spent and countless hours travelled to follow this tour around as best i could... this show topped them all. every song i had been waiting to hear was played; every song that i saw on another setlist that made me say "oh man, i wish they would play that at one of my shows!" showed up tonight. "fake plastic trees" changed my life. "my iron lung" made my cry. "true love waits" made my YEAR. 

what a way to wrap up the tour, guys. holy shit.]]></comment>
