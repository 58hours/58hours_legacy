<comment author="bryanmatthew" timestamp="6:33 AM [PST], Tuesday, May 04, 2004"><![CDATA[I had a feeling that they would put on an amazing show for their japanese fans before they left for australia, and it didn't take long for the band to outdo their previous show, as "there there" was incinerating. from the onset the energy was running high, and the packt crowd responded accordingly. 2+2=5 cooled the frenzy shortly before erupting again once thom began with the "paying attention" bit. awesome. "myxomatosis" sounded brilliant again, "bulletproof" was a gift (as is anything from the bends), and "go to sleep" was incredible. jonny was absolutely otherworldly with an extended demonstration of what can be done when a supremely talented lad wields an instrument. thom, colin, and ed stood at one side of the stage and just starred in amazement in his direction as if they were part of the audience (phil kept drumming, but I'm sure he peeked too). it was that inspired. for the entire 2 hour set I was enthralled by the music, the creativity, and the connection between those onstage and those gathered on the floor. there was something different tonight, and it was exactly this that I felt was lacking a bit the previous night. I can't think of how to describe it. it's felt and it's either there or it isn't. it was there on sunday, and nobody lucky enough to attend will forget their experience. "FOREVER" indeed. best wishes for those attending the australia dates, and especially for those going to coachella. before I forget, I would like to give a sincere arigato towards all @ w.a.s.t.e. for providing fans with choice tickets.  ]]></comment>
