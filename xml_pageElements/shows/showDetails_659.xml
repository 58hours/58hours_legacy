Wow, Radiohead sure knows how to rock.  They sound amazing live, and every sound in their recordings is brought onto the stage.  Lights were amazing, especially for Planet Telax, and Paranoid Android (perfect finish for the perfect night!)]]></comment>
<comment author="Nick" timestamp="3:39 PM [PST], Wednesday, August 20, 2008"><![CDATA[Oh. My. God. Perfection

Everything about it was perfect, light show was unreal, the band was as tight as they were in the studio, setlist was amazing. Thom even let us choose which song to play last. Of course, the heavy rain made Paranoid Android simply transcendant.]]></comment>
<comment author="McKenzie" timestamp="1:10 PM [PST], Wednesday, August 20, 2008"><![CDATA[I've seen over a hundred concerts and I can't remember one that sounded so good. Thom's voice was perfectly mixed and the band were in top form.  The rain and clouds created a great atmosphere for the Radiohead experience... but I can't remember when in my life I was ever so soaked from the rain.  Best surprise song of the concert was Optimistic. ]]></comment>

<comment author="Reggie" timestamp="9:59 AM [PST], Wednesday, August 20, 2008"><![CDATA[Fantastic show by one the best live bands I've ever seen. Particularly enjoyed watching Thom rip up the drum kit on a nasty little song called "Bangers + Mash". Also, amazing version of "Morning Bell" and everything from In Rainbows. The weather was barely a distraction though I was soaking through my drawers.]]></comment>
<comment author="Mike" timestamp="9:10 AM [PST], Wednesday, August 20, 2008"><![CDATA[This was absolutely a religious experience!  "Optimistic" was absolutely the best song of the night.  I loved the intro, too:

"Sorry 'bout the rain, mates.  Oh well, this ones called "OP-timistic."]]></comment>
<comment author="Dave" timestamp="11:47 PM [PST], Tuesday, August 19, 2008"><![CDATA[Awesome, just awesome!  I was freezing cold from the rain but somehow this actually made it better.  Can't say enough good things.]]></comment>
<comment author="Kevin" timestamp="8:48 PM [PST], Tuesday, August 19, 2008"><![CDATA[OMG ! This was the best show I've seen since the Stones at Altamont! The light show was tripfastic!!!!!]]></comment>
