I was also at the Gorge show in 2001, that was my first one, and I thought it was pretty damn good actually.  Mars and the full moon in the background of the amphitheater for this night!!  AWESOME]]></comment>
<comment author="lex" timestamp="4:26 PM [PST], Tuesday, June 06, 2006"><![CDATA[I was front-row center, on the rails, and except for the constant pushing from behind, a great show.  Dollars and Cents was a highlight: the music and lights were ethereal.  ]]></comment>
<comment author="Brian of 58hours" timestamp="8:35 PM [PST], Tuesday, September 23, 2003"><![CDATA[Matt's right.  Johnny's tool of choice for "everything in its right place" is a Kaoss box. For those of us in the states, better found at: <a href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/srs7/sid=030920002107024126243222979996/g=home/search/detail/base_id/85721" target="58link">Musician's Friend.</a>]]></comment>

I think that touch screen box may have been one of these (or a simmilar product): http://www.digitalvillage.co.uk/dv/aproduct.asp?id3=3051

I hope they were as good for you as they were in Camden, NJ.]]></comment>
<comment author="Christopher Reynolds" timestamp="3:15 PM [PST], Friday, September 05, 2003"><![CDATA[This was the best show I've ever seen.  I've been to several Radiohead shows in the states, and this, by far, is the best.  I know they get better with every performance (time proven fact), so I am looking forward to Shoreline.  Lucky was particularly great thanks to the bands energy and the world class stage lighting!  I appreciated Colin bringing the tasty Lowrider bass riff to the National Anthem during the middle portion of the song.  Follow Me Around was a great rarity to hear for the first time, cheers Thom.  Not only was the sound great, but the vibe was as well.  All eyes were riveted to the stage as Radiohead brought everything they had to every song.  EIIRP was great, does anyone know how they sample live music and what the hell that cool-ass touch screen that Jonny and Ed use to mix?  Bottom line, Radiohead sets a new standard for themselves which only they can surpass.  If you have never seen them live, do it.]]></comment>
<comment author="Antonio Castrejon" timestamp="11:57 AM [PST], Tuesday, September 02, 2003"><![CDATA[Well, this was my first radiohead show and I completely blown away. I've heard several live shows and heard most of the studio albums but nothing trully prepared mefor the Radiohead experience. They guys seemed really together playing and singing and trully enjoying what they doing. I've seen a lot of shows in my days and this one ranks up there with some of the best. Fantastic music and stage shows. Thom was really animated through out the show which kept the crowd going and going. As for the audience itself, really great people anjoying a fantastic show. Thanks Radiohead!]]></comment>
<comment author="Adam Quinn" timestamp="12:41 AM [PST], Tuesday, September 02, 2003"><![CDATA[This show was fantastic. I saw them a couple of years ago at the Gorge, and things just seemed like business as usual at the time. But this show was much different. They really seemed to be enjoying themselves. To begin with, Thom was larger than life, jumping around and dancing throughout the show. He lead the crowd to clap their hands on a few occasions and made smiley faces into a camera mounted on top of his piano during "You And Whose Army." Tom made acouple of speeches, one about his Fair Trade agenda (before "Talk Show Host") and going home after the show for a few weeks before returning to the states. "Follow Me Around" was a nice treat. The show ended with only Ed and Johnny on stage, tweeking with sounds at the of "Everything In Its Right Place" (with the word "forever" flashing in lights behind them). The crowd was still hungry when the lights came up, and they only played one song from "The Bends", but all in all, this was a great show... and it was nice to see the guys enjoying themselves as well.]]></comment>
