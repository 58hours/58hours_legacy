<comment author="Nathan Monaghan" timestamp="2:10 PM [PST], Thursday, December 04, 2003"><![CDATA[First things first, I was expecting to be disappointed by this. I'm a massive Radiohead fan, but I don't like their new album that much. I was aware that they were going to play a lot of songs from it, and I didn't like that. Because I didn't think that I was alone in thinking that I wanted a lot of songs from their classics.

But amazingly, they only played the songs from the new album which I like (apart from "Backdrifts") and they also played all of my favourite songs. All of them. It's like the set was made with me in mind!

But words cannot desribe how great this concert was, so I won't even attempt it.]]></comment>

From the moment I spied Ed dancing along to Asian Dub Foundation at the side of the stage, I knew it was going to be special. What impressed me most was how well the new album held up live. Like they did on I Might Be Wrong, they instilled fragile songs with a vigour and power that carried them through to the live arena. Simply breath-taking]]></comment>
