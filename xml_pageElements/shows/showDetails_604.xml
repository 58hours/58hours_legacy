<comment author="Spencer" timestamp="6:40 AM [PST], Wednesday, July 02, 2008"><![CDATA[This was a really great show, all the brand new Kid A stuff made a huge impact, and went down well.  Climbing up the the walls was amazing too, it sounded so much better than it has done on  recent tours, I don't know why they don't do it as well any more.   Thom yelled into his acoustic guitar at the end for that eerie weird vocal sound, and the bass was fat and fuzzy.   the biggest surprise was Permanent Daylight, which Thom felt necessary to introduce by name.   It's decent enough, but ultimately it's a mediocre B side that belongs in the mid 90s. There are far better songs on the My Iron Lung EP (Trickster, Lewis, Punchdrunk, Lozenge) that he could have played, and it got the weakest response of the evening.   Still it's nice for old fans to get a rare surprise track like that.   Everythign in it's Right place would be my stand out.]]></comment>
<comment author="Spencer" timestamp="6:22 AM [PST], Wednesday, July 02, 2008"><![CDATA[hARRY , I seem to remember that National Anthem was in fact  the first song, I remember they came out and played something brand new and totally amazing, which I'm fairly sure was National Anthem. But it's sooooo long ago now that you could be right, what makes you so sure though?  You're definitely wrong about There There full stop, the song hadn't even been written in 2000, it was first performed in 2002, and I definitely don't remember it being played in 2000.  I think your memory is playing tricks with you, 8 years is a long time I suppose. ]]></comment>
<comment author="hARRY" timestamp="6:21 AM [PST], Saturday, June 28, 2008"><![CDATA[setlist is wrong. National Anmthem wasn't anywhere near the first song played and there's no mention oof There, There which was the song which really kicked the gig into life, about 3 songs in I think.]]></comment>
