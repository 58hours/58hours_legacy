<comment author="Amy" timestamp="4:14 AM [PST], Wednesday, October 08, 2003"><![CDATA[The concert was AWESOME!!!  ..by far the best concert I've ever seen live.  They are definitely the best contemporary band around today. the concert was the best night of my life-there really aren't words to describe it]]></comment>

<comment author="sarah" timestamp="2:13 PM [PST], Tuesday, October 07, 2003"><![CDATA[amazing. i might have to say the best concert ive ever been to. and the best band. although i wanted to hear a couple more songs from older albums the set list was great and flowed very well. twas even better because i expected to be on lawn and miraculously managed to squeeze up to section 103 with a friend who had a ticket for that section. AMAZING :)]]></comment>
<comment author="Hank Warner" timestamp="12:46 PM [PST], Tuesday, October 07, 2003"><![CDATA[Wow, fucking great show. I'd never seen them live before and I'm a relatively new fan of the band. The set-list was great and the band flowed so incredibly well. It was cool too see them pull off all of those songs. If your a fan, get off your ass and go see them!]]></comment>
<comment author="Lindsey Musser" timestamp="11:36 AM [PST], Tuesday, October 07, 2003"><![CDATA[What can I say?  Radiohead is great! The show was beautiful and the rainy weather only added to the ambiance.  Needless to say it was everything I could hope for and more. Cheers to the best band of my generation!  ]]></comment>
<comment author="Janet" timestamp="10:59 AM [PST], Tuesday, October 07, 2003"><![CDATA[Without a doubt the best show I have ever been to in my entire life!  Radiohead sure knows how to put on a damn good show.  I dont think I could have asked for a better set list.  Well done!]]></comment>
<comment author="Matt" timestamp="10:00 AM [PST], Tuesday, October 07, 2003"><![CDATA[GREAT Show! Got it all on video if anys up for a B&P DVD-R. - monkeypu@comcast.net]]></comment>
<comment author="Ryan" timestamp="6:28 AM [PST], Tuesday, October 07, 2003"><![CDATA[I saw them once before in NJ, and it was then, the best concert I was ever at. Last nights show blew that show and any other show I have ever seen away... again. The energy they put across to the whole crowd was beautiful. There are not any words that could describe that concert. A complete religious experience!]]></comment>
<comment author="Jeremy Hulsey" timestamp="11:45 PM [PST], Monday, October 06, 2003"><![CDATA[this show was THE best ive seen all year, and ive seen alot of different shows this year.  I love the way Radiohead fucks with the American audience, or at least the section of the audience that just doesnt get it.  They had a very Pink Floydish sound to them tonight, and the music was perfected.  Thom's voice is definitely just as good live.  The only other singers voice that sounds as good live would have to be Maynard James Keenan of TooL.  Sorry for anyone that didn't catch this show.]]></comment>
<comment author="Richard" timestamp="10:32 PM [PST], Monday, October 06, 2003"><![CDATA[JUST got home from the show....1:23am.  This was one incredible night.  From the moment the band hit the stage, the energy level never slacked.  It really looked like the band was having a GREAT time and the crowd really fed off of that.  Talk about a POWERFULL show....the instrumentation was incredible.  It was amazing to see them pull off all of those intricate arrangements live.  The songs from the new album were great and the older songs came off with a new life like I've never heard.  This is a MUST SEE SHOW.  I hope I get another chance this time around.]]></comment>
<comment author="ben" timestamp="10:19 PM [PST], Monday, October 06, 2003"><![CDATA[Awesome show, his birthday was the next day aand it was one of the best setlists ever.  They shuold make this one into a DVD!]]></comment>
<comment author="erkan" timestamp="7:46 PM [PST], Monday, October 06, 2003"><![CDATA[Just got a free concert!(online stream from 99x), very similar tot he 9-26(hollywood, i was there) show, they played really fucking good at this show too. I wish i was there to see them agian! once again radiohead just proved they put on one of the best concerts in the world. ]]></comment>
