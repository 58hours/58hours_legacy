<comment author="zorburt" timestamp="4:26 PM [PST], Sunday, June 29, 2008"><![CDATA[i thought the set list was amazing: they never play the tourist AND airbag. so glad i was there]]></comment>
<comment author="JS" timestamp="3:36 AM [PST], Sunday, June 29, 2008"><![CDATA[I also feel that there was a lack of momentum in the gig. They built up a mood and then threw it away again. Also, coming back on for the last encore in front of all those people who had paid all that money and sitting down at the moody solo piano rather than picking up the distorted electric guitar seemed wilful at best and egomaniacal at worst. 
Almost no communication with the audience didn't help. Big sense of distance between band and crowd. That was the sixth or seventh time I have seen Radiohead, and the first one I haven't enjoyed as much. ]]></comment>
<comment author="JC" timestamp="5:01 AM [PST], Thursday, June 26, 2008"><![CDATA[just why is everyone disappointed with the setlist? it was awesome

some of these songs havent been played at big gigs before, everything radiohead touch seems to turn to gold, so just because you havent got into these songs yet, you should still enjoy them..

few twats just go there to sing karma police and no surprises (which btw i was hoping for but wasnt disappointed)]]></comment>
<comment author="Scott Dillon" timestamp="3:39 AM [PST], Thursday, June 26, 2008"><![CDATA[the only let down, is how much better the second days setlist was. more anthems were played and the setlist is more varied. however, we got the tourist and planet telex, and that for me just makes ours better for me :) cant get over how good they actually were]]></comment>
<comment author="johnlooktothefuture" timestamp="5:57 PM [PST], Wednesday, June 25, 2008"><![CDATA[this is the first time i've seen radiohead, mostly by default(alcohol),but as i suspected they are the greatest band on the planet, overwhelming and trust me i've seen almost all the greats.in a thousand years time people will be studying the genius we've got to see. yippee to us!]]></comment>
<comment author="Martyn" timestamp="2:35 PM [PST], Wednesday, June 25, 2008"><![CDATA[Very, very disappointing due to the weak setlist. Too many slow songs and the period from Wierd Fishes through Dullars and Cents to Faust Arp simply dragged all the momentum away. From then on it was difficult to enjoy the show - no hits, few fan favourites, nothing. 

There is a fine line between leaving your audience wanting more and leaving them wanting their money back, and I'm afraid I fall into the latter.]]></comment>
<comment author="Simon T" timestamp="5:39 AM [PST], Wednesday, June 25, 2008"><![CDATA[I wasnt particularly impressed with the gig. I think it was the sight of a champagne bar on entry and also the number of middle class rug carrying folk that just suprised me. ]]></comment>
<comment author="Josh" timestamp="3:38 AM [PST], Wednesday, June 25, 2008"><![CDATA[Was Amazing

They played some absolute anthems

Was smiling the whole way through]]></comment>
<comment author="Alex" timestamp="3:16 AM [PST], Wednesday, June 25, 2008"><![CDATA[first radiohead show and it was amazing
slightly disappointed with the setlist and crowd
was expecting some kind of mass epiphany
but in any case it was fantastic]]></comment>
<comment author="Will Thomas" timestamp="7:08 PM [PST], Tuesday, June 24, 2008"><![CDATA[I also just got home from the gig. It was pretty mind blowing! Easily a great gig, though I don't think they were loud enough. The levels were perfectly blended with each other but the overall volume should have been lifted... that would have made it better for me, still Airbag was AMAZING and my personal favourite of the night was either All I Need or There There!]]></comment>
<comment author="Scott Dillon" timestamp="6:31 PM [PST], Tuesday, June 24, 2008"><![CDATA[just got back from this show and i was massivley impressed!!! cymbal rush was a huge suprise, the tourist, videotape and planet telex were my favourite of the night, definitley! gutted its over!]]></comment>
