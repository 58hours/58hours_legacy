<comment author="joel" timestamp="11:36 AM [PST], Saturday, January 17, 2004"><![CDATA[The bootleg has been scrapped due to conditions beyond my control.  At the moment, all I have is one huge uncut, unmastered file.  Sorry for any inconvenience and good luck finding another copy.]]></comment>
<comment author="Joel" timestamp="9:38 PM [PST], Saturday, December 13, 2003"><![CDATA[I've submitted this before, but it wasn't posted.  Basically I apologize but due to circumstances out of my control, I won't have a copy of the bootleg finished indefinitely.  Again, sorry.]]></comment>
<comment author="Joel" timestamp="12:09 AM [PST], Tuesday, December 02, 2003"><![CDATA[i'd like to apologize to everyone that has been waiting for a copy of the bootleg.  Due to circumstances out of my control, i will not be able to master the songs and i will not be able, for the time being, break the show down into individual songs.  my computer has experienced unbelievable difficulties and no longer has enough space for me to do any major musical work.  Again, I'm sorry and I wish you all good luck in your search for a proper bootleg.]]></comment>
<comment author="Frank" timestamp="6:30 PM [PST], Thursday, October 09, 2003"><![CDATA[After being a Radiohead fan for 5 years i finally saw them in alping valley. Luckily I was in the pit and not a mile back on the hill. Listening to you and whose army while thom made crazy faces in the camera was definitly the hightlight. ]]></comment>
<comment author="LT" timestamp="8:04 PM [PST], Thursday, September 25, 2003"><![CDATA[My girlfriend and I were in the pit, front row right between Thon and Johnny!! The show was ridiculous, Thom has such intense energy. The NA followed by MYXO was my personal higlight along with the "for a minute there" singalong.  At that point i turned around to 30,000 people "all along and up a hill, with fires going in the distance". Talk about a surreal moment. I'll never forget it.]]></comment>

<comment author="Joel" timestamp="3:43 PM [PST], Thursday, August 28, 2003"><![CDATA[does anyone have pictures?]]></comment>
<comment author="Ben, Jen and Dawn" timestamp="2:32 PM [PST], Thursday, August 28, 2003"><![CDATA[Absolutely the best radiohead performance i've ever seen! We drove from MI through Chicago to see them...and a beautiful venue, too! Loved watching thom jiggering around on stage with the music! I would love bootleg! i want more now...or send me to the moon... blueg1LL@aol.com]]></comment>
<comment author="kl" timestamp="11:09 PM [PST], Tuesday, August 26, 2003"><![CDATA[that was better than sex.
of course, i was lucky enough to be in the pit, and could see every hair on tom's gorgeous head.]]></comment>
<comment author="Joel b." timestamp="10:38 AM [PST], Tuesday, August 26, 2003"><![CDATA[I'm working on my bootleg as we speak.  I'm gonna clean it up with soundforge 6 and make it all nice and perfect.  There's a good chance I'll have it up online somewhere in the next two weeks or so.... fridge_buzzing@hotmail.com]]></comment>
<comment author="B.P." timestamp="3:05 PM [PST], Monday, August 25, 2003"><![CDATA[Bootleg of this awesome show wanted!!
Please email bplageman@hotmail.com
Thanks!]]></comment>
<comment author="Remy" timestamp="1:27 PM [PST], Monday, August 25, 2003"><![CDATA[The best show I've ever been too.  Even better than Chicago in 2001.  And the venue was great, IMO.  (Then again, I was 30 rows up in the center of the pavillion.)  2 days later and I'm still seeing the red/orange lights from Lucky pulsing in my mind.  I want to see them again NOW.]]></comment>
<comment author="B. P." timestamp="11:05 AM [PST], Monday, August 25, 2003"><![CDATA[This may be the best show I have ever seen! Drove almost 600 miles to see it and it was well worth it. I would love a bootleg from this show if any one has one, please drop me a line!]]></comment>
<comment author="Naas-tradamus" timestamp="11:03 AM [PST], Monday, August 25, 2003"><![CDATA[Drove out from Minnepolis for this show.  Alpine is my favorite venue for sightlines and sound (just make sure you're in the pavilion seating).  Radiohead made it the best concert of the summer.  Outstanding on ALL LEVELS.

2 days later, I'm still "high" from that performance.]]></comment>
<comment author="Tom" timestamp="10:45 AM [PST], Monday, August 25, 2003"><![CDATA[how do they recreate those songs live .. i mean really ..shit is incredible.  flew in from nyc for this one.  malkmus was solid and the main event rocked the wheels off.  MORE PLEASE]]></comment>
<comment author="Karen W" timestamp="7:18 AM [PST], Monday, August 25, 2003"><![CDATA[Amazing.  Absolute perfection.  Never had I been to a show where everyone was so engaged, listening intently, soaking up every nuance.  Going to the show was a dream come true.  Thank God for Radiohead!]]></comment>
<comment author="Angelo" timestamp="6:11 PM [PST], Sunday, August 24, 2003"><![CDATA[I drove over 400 miles to see this show.  I would've driven 1000 if I had to.  Absolutly mind-blowing! Even better than when I saw them on the OK Computer tour.  On the downside it took us 2+1/2 hours just to get out of the parking lot--oh well...it was still worth it.]]></comment>
<comment author="adamw" timestamp="4:49 PM [PST], Sunday, August 24, 2003"><![CDATA["this is a dirty song for dirty people!" yorke exclaimed before they broke in Myxomatosis. I didn't mind the venue. being outside is nice and if you got up front (on the lawn) you could see EVERYTHING... that place just got too crowded. what an amazing show, though]]></comment>
<comment author="Dan A." timestamp="7:38 AM [PST], Sunday, August 24, 2003"><![CDATA[the whole thing was too magical, all i remember is it started off with 2+2=5 and Sit Down, Stand Up----and the last two songs were Karma Police and then Everything In Its Right Place.  The performance was amazing, but the venue was just God-awful.]]></comment>
