<comment author="David" timestamp="8:21 AM [PST], Tuesday, July 01, 2008"><![CDATA[I didn't attend this gig, but had been to my first show by the band earlier in the week in Glasgow.  The fact the setlist was so similar (except Pyramid song here where we got Like Spinning Plates... and the addition of Lucky) can only mean anyone attending this one got a great show too.  

What I'd have given to have had the Glasgow gig signed off by Lucky, probably my favourite track of theirs.  The Manchester crowd certainly seemed fortunate. 

Brilliant tour! ]]></comment>
<comment author="Mark" timestamp="3:19 PM [PST], Monday, June 30, 2008"><![CDATA[The first time I've seen Radiohead live, and the contrast between the professional tightness and complexity, and the emotion is the best I've seen. The sound is incredible for an outdoor gig. There seems to be danger in avery song as it's so ambitious, but they nailed every one. Radiohead a have been the soundtrack to my life for the last 10 years or so, I was nervous on the way to the gig that they's spoil something I couldn't name, it's fine now. Thank yoy  Mark Williams]]></comment>

Absolutely phenomenal!!!!!
only about 3 people infront of me i was so close to the front, incredible gig, best of my life
THANKS RADIOHEAD]]></comment>

The In Rainbows stuff held up much better live than I had thought it would. All I Need was one of my favourite tracks of the night.

Hearing Fake Plastic Trees was awesome, Karma Police was immense, 2+2=5 and Paranoid Android kicked ass. Pyramid Song was beautiful, Idioteque riotous, and the bonus encore of Lucky (they had time left on the meter) was a fantastic way to cap the night.]]></comment>
