A group of us went & queued up for ages outside, tickets in hand.. We had arrived early. Some of us quickly went around the back of the Ent. centre & caught Colin (Greenwood) on his way in, We said G'day, he signed my shorts and some other peoples' clothing and we raced back around to the front of the queue where the rest of the group was and raced into the front railing. 

They played one of the most enjoyable and awesome sets I had experienced, and still to this day although my music tastes have changed Radiohead stand out for me & I thank them for giving us kids in Perth a wicked show.

I was 15 then, I'm 21 now.. I heard they are doing another Australian tour in 2004 around April, but they are not coming back to Perth this time.  I am saving up money to fly over to Sydney to see them again.

Cheers,

k.
