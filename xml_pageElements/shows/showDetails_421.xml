Highlights for me included my iron lung, karma police, wolf at the door, street spirit, fake plastic trees, Just, There There, I will... oh crap practically all the songs we highlights and all performed superbly, best gig ever? second best only to 27th Earls Court.]]></comment>
<comment author="Ben" timestamp="12:55 PM [PST], Friday, January 09, 2004"><![CDATA[i've never seen radiohead before, and before going to the concert i wasnt sure what to expect from a band who have changed so much within six albums, but thankfully the band now know how to please their fans - both old and new, and long may they continue to do so. Personal highlights had to be the ferocious 2+2=5 and just, and the amazing idioteque and kid A, and never have i seen a song performed live as beautifully as fake plastic trees.
radiohead seem to be finally enjoying themselves.]]></comment>
<comment author="Todd Craig" timestamp="11:46 AM [PST], Monday, December 08, 2003"><![CDATA[This was the 6th time I've seen Radiohead and the best since the Festival Hall show I saw in 2000. They really have managed to finally find the balance between the older rocking songs that brought them so many fans in the 90's and the newer more electronic elegiac songs. "Just" simply tore the roof off. I was suprememly impressed by the clarity of sound they managed to get in such a cavernous hall. The audience clapping together every 2 bars on "We Suck Young Blood" was an amazing sound and brought an element of audience participation that I've never seen before. Overall, they played a great mix of tough, upfront and loud and soft and touching. As a fan for 9 years now, I think they have truly discovered how to please everyone. Including themselves.]]></comment>
<comment author="Ben Haldenby" timestamp="12:45 PM [PST], Sunday, November 30, 2003"><![CDATA[This show was the first time I'd seen Radiohead live and they were phenomenal. I had a bad feeling that they would be cold and aloof live but I couldn't have been more wrong. Thom was enigmatic and funny; the mock pantomime hamming up of You and Whose Army as he leered into the camera was great. Personal highlights include Karma Police and Kid A and the finale of Everything In Its Right Place was nothing short of astounding. Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever...]]></comment>
