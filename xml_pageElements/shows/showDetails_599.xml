<comment author="Brett" timestamp="10:06 AM [PST], Friday, February 23, 2007"><![CDATA[Greatest show, performance, night of my life.  Words can't describe what Radiohead did that night.  Absolutely mind blowing.  This was my first time to see them play live and it blew away every single high expectation that I had for them.  After 2 and a half hours of playing I wanted them to do it all over again.  I was speechless afterwards.  I am desperately waiting for lp7 and their next tour.  ]]></comment>
<comment author="Jake" timestamp="8:18 AM [PST], Thursday, July 06, 2006"><![CDATA[This popped my Radiohead Cherry. I'd listened to them a bit before and always enjoyed their music, but I was anticipating Beck, Lesh, and Oysterhead much more. What a fool I was. Radiohead only played the most amazing performance I've ever seen. EVER. I say with one hundred percent honesty that it was withtin the top best five things of ALL TIME. I perhaps took a more negative view of things afterward, as it wasn't "Now I can die happy," but rather something along the lines of "You might as well kill me now, because it won't get any better in my lifetime than this show. Maybe I'm not doing this sex thing right, but this show was better than 90% of the sex I've had, not that that's an exorbitant amount or anything.

On another note, hallucinogenics aren't a must-have, but they do make it about a million times beeter, if that's even possible. At a certain point in the show, me and my friends felt like it was winding down, so I asked what time it was. My buddy looked at his watch and said to me in a grave tone, "Dude, we still have two more hours of sheduled Radiohead," at which point we all broke down in to fits of euphoric giggles. 

Even after all this, words can't come close. Get to a Radiohead show. Now.]]></comment>

for this show, i personally had to wait at the stage security bars from 7am till 11:30am, then i had to run a football field size arena to get a decent spot and once i got that, i had to [for the most part] stand there for 9 hours straight under the burning sun... but it was worth every fucking minute of it. at the end of the show i turned to my friend and said "i think i can die in peace now". 
i really can.]]></comment>
<comment author="Logan Sullivan" timestamp="2:26 PM [PST], Monday, June 19, 2006"><![CDATA[this show was the best i have ever been to. it even topped 311 day which 311 is like my favorite band. but if you ever get the chance to see radiohead. do it. hallucinogenics weren't a bad idea either... it was definately a trip i'll remember...]]></comment>

<comment author="Al Frazier" timestamp="10:15 AM [PST], Sunday, June 18, 2006"><![CDATA[Excellent show and performance. Very tender, actually.  Two really tame encores ending the night with "Everything In It's Right Place".  Notable items left on the plate that would have played well to the 100k+ (mostly southern) crowd:  My Iron Lung, High & Dry, True Love Waits, I Might Be Wrong...]]></comment>
