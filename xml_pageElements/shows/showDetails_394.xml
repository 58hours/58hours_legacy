<comment author="Smacky" timestamp="11:20 PM [PST], Friday, October 17, 2003"><![CDATA[This was an awesome show. I've seen Radiohead my share of times and this was easily the best. Every song was tight. I've never seen the band so energetic and happy to be playing for us. The blend of heavy then soft and their mastery of songs such as The Gloaming- which was a little raw in early performances- was perfection. I was right in front of Ed against the gate. The band was just as excited playing Android Paranoid as they were during the OK tour. I also saw the Atlanta show from this tour and NOLA easily blew it away. If you find a recording of this show GET IT! Exceptional Show.]]></comment>
