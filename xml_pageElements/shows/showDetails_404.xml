<comment author="Dan" timestamp="6:42 PM [PST], Wednesday, October 29, 2003"><![CDATA[awesome show! It completely blew my mind. What other band could make a Skydome concert sound so good. Would have loved to hear "True Love Waits" or "Just"... but that is not a complaint. No complaints for the greatest show on earth!!]]></comment>
<comment author="too much rope" timestamp="7:26 PM [PST], Sunday, October 19, 2003"><![CDATA[   One of the best shows I've seen, even though the venue was horrible. The ammount of control demonstrated by the band was very impressive. A fan passed out like twenty feet from the stage and Thom Yorke stopped a song dead comment that "his eyes have gone over." I think it was in the middle of Myxomatosis but I'm not certain. He told the crowd to get him up and they moved him toward some security guys who carried him away. When he was safe, Yorke said something about the third verse and the band when back into it. Like nothing happened at all.]]></comment>
<comment author="fanny" timestamp="4:47 PM [PST], Friday, October 17, 2003"><![CDATA[this show was like a religious experience. honestly, i could not have hoped or asked for anything more. and please...how can you not stand? if i wanted to sit, i wouldn't have paid 70 dollars to go to a concert. chairs are merely a suggestion. 
"how to disappear completely" brought tears to my eyes. this was the quintessence of brilliance.]]></comment>
<comment author="Randy" timestamp="1:45 PM [PST], Friday, October 17, 2003"><![CDATA[Just got to say...the show was #@!!&%$tastic. I was on the floor with my son and his friend; the vantage from their was great. Everyone around us was into the show too which was excellent. The highlight for me was "There There" and a great version of "Fake Plastic Trees". This band rocks!!!]]></comment>
<comment author="Elyse Connery" timestamp="1:43 PM [PST], Friday, October 17, 2003"><![CDATA[Holy shit, who the hell are you to tell people to sit during a concert??? that's ridiculous! Ya it sucks they didn't play street spirit, but hell, I GOT TO SEE RADIOHEAD.  I dare not complain, unless it's to say more people needed to stand during the show.]]></comment>
<comment author="cathy" timestamp="7:51 PM [PST], Thursday, October 16, 2003"><![CDATA[I've got to say that I hated the people sitting around me. I jumped to my feet as soon as they hit the stage, but then felt guilted into sitting down again. I ended up paying $70 to sit on my butt, enviously eyeing the people on the floor who were really into it. How could you not feel compelled to move during songs like Myxomatosis or Punchup at a Wedding? Even Fake Plastic Trees inspires me to get my sway on.]]></comment>
<comment author="J Wang" timestamp="7:20 PM [PST], Thursday, October 16, 2003"><![CDATA[It was an amazing show but I really think that there was no need to stand for any songs until the encores, the standers ruined an otherwise great view and the guys behind us bitched about everything the entire show.  I was just trying to enjoy it, still had an amazing time, but people please, just sit!]]></comment>
<comment author="Darrin" timestamp="7:43 AM [PST], Thursday, October 16, 2003"><![CDATA[I hate to ooze, but I must.  Show was... no adjectives come to mid.  Skydome is one of the deadest-sounding venues in the world as far as I'm concerned, but it got rocked last night.  Another religious experience for me, courtesy of the boys... Myxomatosis... again, no words to describe it.  Cheers lads, see you again.]]></comment>
<comment author="bc_girl" timestamp="6:56 AM [PST], Thursday, October 16, 2003"><![CDATA[Excellent show. Great vibe (at least on the floor). Thom stopped the show in the middle of the 7th song to alert sercurity that a fan had passed out in the front.]]></comment>
<comment author="BEL" timestamp="5:50 AM [PST], Thursday, October 16, 2003"><![CDATA[This was the third time I've seen Radiohead in concert and, once again, they were fantastic!    only let-down--no Pyramid Song or Street Spirit  OR True Love Waits...ppl in NYC, you lucky bastards! ;) ]]></comment>
