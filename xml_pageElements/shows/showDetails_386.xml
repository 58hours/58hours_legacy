<comment author="w0lfatthedoor" timestamp="10:29 PM [PST], Thursday, September 25, 2003"><![CDATA[Good, but could have been better. There was kind of a lack of  the beautiful, sad songs that I love from Radiohead like Street Spirt, Like Spinning Plates, True Love Waits, Big Ideas, and the like. The highlight of the show was the "rain down" part of Paranoid Android... and it shouldn't have been!

Oh well, The Gloaming, My Iron Lung, and Sail to the Moon certainly rocked. So did How to Diappear... ]]></comment>
<comment author="Carly" timestamp="5:23 PM [PST], Thursday, September 25, 2003"><![CDATA[Yeah, Thom skipped the first verse... I think he tried to go back and sing it after the 2nd verse but messed himself up... which is when he said sorry.  But, we didnt care.  Loved it even more actually.  Sat on the lawn, couldn't see a thing, and I still think that was one of the best concerts I've ever been to.  Brilliant.]]></comment>
<comment author="Tcox" timestamp="12:02 PM [PST], Thursday, September 25, 2003"><![CDATA[My first Radiohead show.  Brilliant!  And on the Equinox no less.

I was wondering...did Thom mess up the lyrics to "Everything in its right place"?  I could have sworn that he started with "There are two colors in my head," as opposed to "Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon," and then he seemed to put his head in his hands a couple times and even got up from the piano.  I would even swear that he said "sorry" later on in the song.

I only ask this because in the review from the "Chronicle" the writer quotes Thom as saying the "lemon" line but I don't think he did.]]></comment>
